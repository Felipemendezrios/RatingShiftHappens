The model does not require any a priori knowledge of the river geometry (width and depth) or hydraulic conditions (hydraulic slope and friction coefficient) as those parameters are inferred by inverse modeling. The model is fast in that several decades of hourly discharges can be reproduced in few seconds on any modern desktop computer. The method is accurate in that it reproduces to within 3\% the observed tidal discharge variability at 8 different cross-sections distributed along the tidally influenced portion of the St.~Lawrence River. Although much simpler, the new method performs as well as, or better than, much more sophisticated models for reproducing daily and monthly discharge averages. Being physically based, it is also shown that the model can perform well outside the limited range of measurements that are generally available for calibration. The method is simple and easy to manage in that the main function only contains a few lines of code such that it could be readily implemented as a tool for real-time discharge monitoring of the St. Lawrence River near Qu{\'e}bec City. Being physically based, the model developed here could likely be applied more generally to highly unsteady tidal rivers with flow reversals.           ,              Key Points                                                                A simple, physically based, nonlinear, and nonsteady method is developed to obtain river discharges from water levels                                                     The method can reproduce the discharge of the St. Lawrence River, from tidal to climatic time scales, as accurately as more complex models                                                     The simplicity of the method makes it suitable for real-time monitoring},

  abstract = {Mixing models have become requisite tools for analyzing biotracer data, most commonly stable isotope ratios, to infer dietary contributions of multiple sources to a consumer. However, Bayesian mixing models will always return a result that defaults to their priors if the data poorly resolve the source contributions, and thus, their interpretation requires caution. We describe an application of information theory to quantify how much has been learned about a consumer's diet from new biotracer data. We apply the approach to two example data sets. We find that variation in the isotope ratios of sources limits the precision of estimates for the consumer's diet, even with a large number of consumer samples. Thus, the approach which we describe is a type of power analysis that uses a priori simulations to find an optimal sample size. Biotracer data are fundamentally limited in their ability to discriminate consumer diets. We suggest that other types of data, such as gut content analysis, must be used as prior information in model fitting, to improve model learning about the consumer's diet. Information theory may also be used to identify optimal sampling protocols in situations where sampling of consumers is limited due to expense or ethical concerns.},

  abstract = {Abstract. As the tidal wave propagates into an estuary, the tidally averaged water level tends to rise in landward direction due to the density difference between saline and fresh water and the asymmetry of the friction. The effect of friction on the residual slope is even more remarkable when accounting for fresh water discharge. In this study, we investigate the influence of river discharge on tidal wave propagation in the Yangtze estuary with specific attention to residual water level slope. This is done by using a one-dimensional analytical model for tidal hydrodynamics accounting for the residual water level. We demonstrate the importance of the residual slope on tidal dynamics and use it to improve the prediction of the tidal propagation in estuaries (i.e. tidal damping, velocity amplitude, wave celerity and phase lag), especially when the influence of river discharge is significant. Finally, we develop a new inverse analytical approach for estimating fresh water discharge on the basis of tidal water level observations along the estuary, which can be used as a tool to obtain information on the river discharge that is otherwise difficult to measure in the tidal region.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The stage-discharge rating curve is subject at many hydrometric stations to sudden changes (shifts) typically caused by morphogenic floods. We propose an original method for estimating shift times using the stage-discharge observations, also known as gaugings. This method is based on a recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties through a Bayesian framework. It starts with the estimation of a baseline rating curve using all available gaugings. Then it computes the residuals between the gaugings and this rating curve with uncertainties. It proceeds with the segmentation of the time series of residuals through a multi-change point Bayesian estimation accounting for residuals uncertainties. Once the first set of shift times is identified, the same procedure is recursively applied to each sub-period through a ``top-down'' approach searching for all effective shifts. The proposed method is illustrated using the Ard{\`e}che River at Meyras in France (a typical hydrometric site subject to river bed degradation) and evaluated using several synthetic data sets for which the true shift times are known. The applications confirm the added value of the recursive segmentation compared with a ``single-pass'' approach and highlight the importance of properly accounting for uncertainties in the segmented data. The recursive procedure effectively disentangles rating changes from observational and rating curve uncertainties.           ,              Plain Language Summary             For many hydrological and hydraulic issues, such as flood forecasting, a reliable river discharge estimate is needed. In general, discharge is derived from the recorded water level (stage) through a stage-discharge relation (rating curve). This relation is calibrated using direct observations (gaugings). Unfortunately, the rating curve is not only uncertain but it can also be subject to sudden changes or shifts due for example to intense floods that modify the river bed geometry. One solution to identify periods of rating curve stability is to apply a segmentation procedure to the gaugings. We propose in this paper an original recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties.           ,              Key Points                                                                We propose a method for detecting rating shifts through the segmentation of residuals between the gaugings and a reference rating curve                                                     The method accounts for observational and rating curve uncertainties and expresses change points in terms of time (rather than position)                                                     The method recursively re-estimates the reference rating curve to improve the detection of small shifts},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will vastly expand measurements of global rivers, providing critical new data sets for both gaged and ungaged basins. SWOT discharge products (available approximately 1~year after launch) will provide discharge for all river that reaches wider than 100~m. In this paper, we describe how SWOT discharge produced and archived by the US and French space agencies will be computed from measurements of river water surface elevation, width, and slope and ancillary data, along with expected discharge accuracy. We present for the first time a complete estimate of the SWOT discharge uncertainty budget, with separate terms for random (standard error) and systematic (bias) uncertainty components in river discharge time series. We expect that discharge uncertainty will be less than 30\% for two-thirds of global reaches and will be dominated by bias. Separate river discharge estimates will combine both SWOT and in situ data; these ``gage-constrained'' discharge estimates can be expected to have lower systematic uncertainty. Temporal variations in river discharge time series will be dominated by random error and are expected to be estimated within 15\% for nearly all reaches, allowing accurate inference of event flow dynamics globally, including in ungaged basins. We believe this level of accuracy lays the groundwork for SWOT to enable breakthroughs in global hydrologic science.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission was launched on 15 December 2022. SWOT is designed to produce estimates of river discharge on many rivers where no in situ discharge measurements are currently available. This paper describes how SWOT discharge estimates will be created, and their expected accuracy. SWOT discharge will be estimated using simple flow laws that combine SWOT measurements of river water elevation above sea level, river width, and river slope, with ancillary data such as river bathymetry. We expect that discharge uncertainty will be less than 30\% for two-thirds of global reaches and will be dominated by a systematic bias. Temporal variations in river discharge time series are expected to be estimated within 15\% for nearly all reaches, thus capturing the response of river discharge to rainfall and snowmelt events, including in basins that are currently ungaged, and providing a new capability for scientists to better track the flows of freshwater water through the Earth system.           ,              Key Points                                                                The Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission is designed to enable the estimation of discharge for global rivers wider than 100~m                                                     When unconstrained by in situ data, discharge uncertainty is expected to be {$<$}30\% for most reaches, and to be dominated by systematic bias                                                     We expect discharge temporal variations to be estimated to within 15\% for nearly all reaches globally},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will allow the estimation of discharge in rivers wider than 100 m, filling important gaps in the network of in situ measurements. This novel source of discharge observations has the potential to enable significant progress toward closing Earth's water budget and creating new understanding of the water cycle. Quantifying the uncertainty in the SWOT estimates of discharge, mapping the error sources, and understanding their relative importance is essential to the fulfillment of this potential. Here, we break the SWOT discharge production process into its essential parts: 1) retrieval of river width and water surface heights and slopes, 2) estimation of unobservable parameters, and 3) computation of discharge with the selected flow law, and through a Monte Carlo simulation study, we assess the sensitivity of the overall discharge error to each of these parts. We analyze the discharge error characteristics in terms of bias, error standard deviation, and the correlation between true and retrieved discharges and map the contribution of the essential discharge production elements to each of the error metrics. Our study revealed that biases in parameters are the most important source of discharge biases, yet we found that a larger than expected fraction of the discharge biases can be attributed to observation errors. Surprisingly, we found that parameter biases are also the most important contributor to discharge error standard deviation and to the deterioration of the correlation between truth and retrieved discharges, which were previously thought of as being controlled by observation errors.}

  abstract = {Summary                            Estimating river discharge from               in situ               and/or remote sensing data is a key issue for evaluation of water balance at local and global scales and for water management. Variational data assimilation (DA) is a powerful approach used in operational weather and ocean forecasting, which can also be used in this context. A distinctive feature of the river discharge estimation problem is the likely presence of significant uncertainty in principal parameters of a hydraulic model, such as bathymetry and friction, which have to be included into the control vector alongside the discharge. However, the conventional variational DA method being used for solving such extended problems often fails. This happens because the control vector iterates (i.e., approximations arising in the course of minimization) result into hydraulic states not supported by the model. In this paper, we suggest a novel version of the variational DA method specially designed for solving estimation-under-uncertainty problems, which is based on the ideas of iterative regularization.                                         The method is implemented with SIC               2               , which is a full Saint-Venant based 1D-network model. The SIC               2               software is widely used by research, consultant and industrial communities for modeling river, irrigation canal, and drainage network behavior. The adjoint model required for variational DA is obtained by means of automatic differentiation. This is likely to be the first stable consistent adjoint of the 1D-network model of a commercial status in existence.                          The DA problems considered in this paper are offtake/tributary estimation under uncertainty in the cross-device parameters and inflow discharge estimation under uncertainty in the bathymetry defining parameters and the friction coefficient. Numerical tests have been designed to understand identifiability of discharge given uncertainty in bathymetry and friction. The developed methodology, and software seems useful in the context of the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) NASA satellite mission will measure water surface width, height, and slope of major rivers worldwide. The resulting data could provide an unprecedented account of river discharge at continental scales, but reliable methods need to be identified prior to launch. Here we present a novel algorithm for discharge estimation from only remotely sensed stream width, slope, and height at multiple locations along a mass-conserved river segment. The algorithm, termed the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm, implements a Bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of Manning's equation and at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). Bayesian methods provide a statistically defensible approach to generating discharge estimates in a physically underconstrained system but rely on prior distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters. These were obtained from literature-reported values and from a USGS data set of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements at USGS stream gauges. A data set of simulated widths, slopes, and heights from 19 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithms using a set of performance metrics. Results across the 19 rivers indicate an improvement in performance of BAM over previously tested methods and highlight a path forward in solving discharge estimation using solely satellite remote sensing.           ,              Key Points                                                                A new method is presented for estimating discharge using satellite observations                                                     The method uses Bayesian inference via hydraulics-derived likelihood and empirical priors from existing data sources                                                     Performance improvements over previous estimation algorithms are demonstrated on benchmark data sets},

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model for estimating the relative contributions of different dietary components to the tissues of consumers within food webs. The model is implemented with the probabilistic programming language Stan. The model incorporates isotopes of multiple elements (e.g. C, N, H) for two trophic levels, when the structure of the food web is known. In addition, the model allows inclusion of latent trophic levels (i.e. for which no empirical data are available) intermediate between sources and measured consumers. Running the model in simulations driven by a real dataset from Finnish lakes, we tested the sensitivity of the posterior distributions by altering critical prior parameters and assumptions in the data-generating process. Importantly, we found that the model estimations were particularly sensitive to the assigned prior value for {$\omega$} (the fraction of H in aquatic consumer tissue that is derived from environmental water rather than diet) so that reliable empirical data for this parameter are required. When reliable information is not available for {$\omega$}, we suggest that an uninformative prior should be used. The proposed model and inferences are suitable for studies where resources for collecting new data are limited, but useful prior information for each specific trophic level is available from earlier studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Stage measurement errors are generally overlooked when streamflow time series are derived from uncertain rating curves. We introduce an original method for propagating stage uncertainties due to two types of stage measurement errors: (i) errors of the stage read during the gauging and (ii) systematic and nonsystematic (independent) errors of the recorded stage time series. The error models are generic and can be used for any probabilistic rating curve estimation method that provides an ensemble of rating curves. The new method is applied to a range of six contrasting hydrometric stations in France. Uncertainty budgets quantifying the contribution of various error sources to the total streamflow uncertainty are computed and compared for streamflow time series averaged at time intervals from hour to year. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the stage time series error model to identify the most sensitive parameters. The results are site specific, which illustrates the key role played by the properties of both the hydrometric site and the gauged catchment. Across the range of sites, stage errors of the gaugings are found to have limited impact on rating curve uncertainty, at least for gaugings performed in fair conditions. Nonsystematic errors in the stage time series have a negligible effect, generally. However, systematic stage errors should not be neglected. Over the six hydrometric stations in this study, the 95\% uncertainty component reflecting stage systematic errors (from {\textpm}0.5 cm to {\textpm}6.8 cm) alone ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average streamflow, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average streamflow as sensors were assumed to be recalibrated every 30 days. Perspectives for improving and validating the streamflow uncertainty estimation techniques are eventually discussed.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Water discharges in rivers are monitored by measuring the water level (known as stage) every 15 minutes or so and by converting it to discharge with a calibrated stage-discharge model (known as rating curve). We introduce an original method for computing the uncertainty of water discharge time series due to the measurement errors of the stage records used as inputs of the stage-discharge model. Systematic errors in stage measurements, for instance due to sensor drift or calibration errors, were found to produce non negligible discharge uncertainties. Over six hydrometric stations with varied conditions, the corresponding discharge uncertainty ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average discharge, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average discharge.           ,              Key Points                                                                Stage errors in gaugings and in stage time series affect streamflow computation                                                     Specific error models are introduced and used to compute streamflow time series uncertainties                                                     Effect of stage errors depends on site characteristics and averaging time intervals, systematic stage errors being the most impactful},

  abstract = {Abstract. Hydrodynamic modeling has been increasingly used to simulate water surface elevation which is important for flood prediction and risk assessment. Scarcity and inaccessibility of in~situ bathymetric information have hindered hydrodynamic model development at continental-to-global scales. Therefore, river cross-section geometry is commonly approximated by highly simplified generic shapes. Hydrodynamic river models require both bed geometry and roughness as input parameters. Simultaneous calibration of shape parameters and roughness is difficult, because often there are trade-offs between them. Instead of parameterizing cross-section geometry and hydraulic roughness separately, this study introduces a parameterization of 1D~hydrodynamic models by combining cross-section geometry and roughness into one conveyance parameter. Flow area and conveyance are expressed as power~laws of flow depth, and they are found to be linearly related in log--log space at reach scale. Data from a wide range of river systems show that the linearity approximation is globally applicable. Because the two are expressed as power~laws of flow depth, no further assumptions about channel geometry are needed. Therefore, the hydraulic inversion approach allows for calibrating flow area and conveyance curves in the absence of direct observations of bathymetry and hydraulic roughness. The feasibility and performance of the hydraulic inversion workflow are illustrated using satellite observations of river width and water surface elevation in the Songhua river, China. Results show that this approach is able to reproduce water level dynamics with root-mean-square error values of 0.44~and 0.50\,m at two gauging stations, which is comparable to that achieved using a standard calibration approach. In summary, this study puts forward an alternative method to parameterize and calibrate river models using satellite observations of river width and water surface elevation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Stage-fall-discharge (SFD) rating curves are traditionally used to compute streamflow records at sites where the energy slope of the flow is variable due to variable backwater effects. We introduce a model with hydraulically interpretable parameters for estimating SFD rating curves and their uncertainties. Conventional power functions for channel and section controls are used. The transition to a backwater-affected channel control is computed based on a continuity condition, solved either analytically or numerically. The practical use of the method is demonstrated with two real twin-gauge stations, the Rh{\^o}ne River at Valence, France, and the Guthusbekken stream at station 0003{$\cdot$}0033, Norway. Those stations are typical of a channel control and a section control, respectively, when backwater-unaffected conditions apply. The performance of the method is investigated through sensitivity analysis to prior information on controls and to observations (i.e., available gaugings) for the station of Valence. These analyses suggest that precisely identifying SFD rating curves requires adapted gauging strategy and/or informative priors. The Madeira River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon, provides a challenging case typical of large, flat, tropical river networks where bed roughness can also be variable in addition to slope. In this case, the difference in staff gauge reference levels must be estimated as another uncertain parameter of the SFD model. The proposed Bayesian method is a valuable alternative solution to the graphical and empirical techniques still proposed in hydrometry guidance and standards.           ,              Key Points                                                                A Bayesian method with hydraulically interpretable parameters for stage-fall-discharge rating curves                                                     Sensitivity analyses to available prior information and gaugings                                                     Application to three twin-gauge stations, with distinct hydraulic configurations},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Satellite-based optical video sensors are poised as the next frontier in remote sensing. Satellite video offers the unique advantage of capturing the transient dynamics of floods with the potential to supply hitherto unavailable data for the assessment of hydraulic models. A prerequisite for the successful application of hydraulic models is their proper calibration and validation. In this investigation, we validate 2D flood model predictions using satellite video-derived flood extents and velocities. Hydraulic simulations of a flood event with a 5-year return period (discharge of 722~m               3               ~s               -1               ) were conducted using Hydrologic Engineering Center---River Analysis System 2D in the Darling River at Tilpa, Australia. To extract flood extents from satellite video of the studied flood event, we use a hybrid transformer-encoder, convolutional neural network (CNN)-decoder deep neural network. We evaluate the influence of test-time augmentation (TTA)---the application of transformations on test satellite video image ensembles, during deep neural network inference. We employ Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) for non-contact-based river surface velocity estimation from sequential satellite video frames. When validating hydraulic model simulations using deep neural network segmented flood extents, critical success index peaked at 94\% with an average relative improvement of 9.5\% when TTA was implemented. We show that TTA offers significant value in deep neural network-based image segmentation, compensating for aleatoric uncertainties. The correlations between model predictions and LSPIV velocities were reasonable and averaged 0.78. Overall, our investigation demonstrates the potential of optical space-based video sensors for validating flood models and studying flood dynamics.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             Videos of the Earth surface recorded by satellites can enable us to observe and characterize dynamic moving features, such as floods, that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to investigate from the ground. Hydrologists often rely on using physics-based computer models to simulate flood events, but require observational data to make sure these reflect reality accurately. We use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically detect flood extents from satellite video, and track surface features from frame to frame in order to measure how fast the water surface is flowing. Satellite video was collected during opportunistically clear skies in January 2022, along a 6.5~km length of the River Darling in Australia. The flood extent and flow velocities were used to improve numerical model predictions of the flood event. Our findings demonstrate the considerable promise of satellite video to complement existing flood mapping and modeling approaches, and to provide insight into the earth's hydrosphere, particularly in remote locations and during extreme conditions.           ,              Key Points                                                                Satellite video derived flood extents and velocities successfully validate 2D hydraulic model predictions                                                     Test-time augmentation during deep learning inference improved flood extent delineation and enhanced 2D model validation metrics                                                     Incorporating characterization of discharge uncertainty into hydraulic model predictions resulted in more accurate model validation},

  abstract = {Abstract. This contribution presents a novel multi-dimensional (multi-D) hydraulic--hydrological numerical model with variational data assimilation capabilities. It allows multi-scale modeling over large domains, combining in situ observations with high-resolution hydrometeorology and satellite data. The multi-D hydraulic model relies on the 2D shallow-water equations solved with a 1D--2D adapted single finite-volume solver. One-dimensional-like reaches are built through meshing methods that cause the 2D solver to degenerate into 1D. They are connected to 2D portions that act as local zooms, for modeling complex flow zones such as floodplains and confluences, via 1D-like--2D interfaces. An existing parsimonious hydrological model, GR4H, is implemented and coupled to the hydraulic model. The forward-inverse multi-D computational model is successfully validated on virtual and real cases of increasing complexity, including using the second-order scheme version. Assimilating multiple observations of flow signatures leads to accurate inferences of multi-variate and spatially distributed parameters among bathymetry friction, upstream and lateral hydrographs and hydrological model parameters. This notably demonstrates the possibility for information feedback towards upstream hydrological catchments, that is, backward hydrology. A 1D-like model of part of the Garonne River is built and accurately reproduces flow lines and propagations of a 2D reference model. A multi-D model of the complex Adour basin network, with inflow from the semi-distributed hydrological model, is built. High-resolution flow simulations are obtained on a large domain, including fine zooms on floodplains, with a relatively low computational cost since the network contains mostly 1D-like reaches. The current work constitutes an upgrade of the DassFlow computational platform. The adjoint of the whole tool chain is obtained by automatic code differentiation.},

Le code de calcul de BaRatin est actuellement diffus{\'e} accompagn{\'e} de son interface graphique BaRatinAGE. BaRatinAGE ne consid{\`e}re actuellement que le cas des courbes de tarage dites simples, pour lesquelles le d{\'e}bit est d{\'e}termin{\'e} {\`a} partir de la hauteur d'eau seulement. Les r{\'e}cents travaux de th{\`e}se de Valentin Mansanarez (2016) ont permis de mettre en place des mod{\`e}les de courbes de tarage dites complexes, pour lesquelles le d{\'e}bit ne d{\'e}pend pas uniquement de la hauteur, mais {\'e}galement d'autres variables d'entr{\'e}e. Il est donc n{\'e}cessaire de g{\'e}n{\'e}raliser ce code de calcul pour qu'il puisse g{\'e}rer des mod{\`e}les poss{\'e}dant plusieurs variables d'entr{\'e}e.

  abstract = {In global sensitivity analysis, ubiquitous Sobol indices are used to quantify the effect of the variation of some input parameters of a model on the variance of the model outputs at each time-step and at each spatial point of the model. This paper introduces the coupling of the 1D numerical solver for transient open-channel flows Mage with Melissa, a framework for large scale in-transit sensitivity analysis. This framework is fault tolerant and can manage the specific cases in which some sets of parameters can lead to a divergence in the numerical solver that causes an early stop of the simulation. In addition, as the Sobol index estimators are computed iteratively and in-transit, the analysis is run in parallel to the simulations and results are available as soon as the last simulation ends. Moreover, as the simulation results are not stored on the file-system, it allows to run large scale sensitivity analysis without extra cost on disk usage and read/write overhead. The Lower Seine River, a tide river, is being used to demonstrate the quantification of the influence of a set of Strickler coefficients on the water elevation and the flow rate over a tidal cycle. The Lower Seine River model is segmented into 14 zones, each with independent constant Strickler coefficients. Tidal transient models are challenging to calibrate because the Strickler coefficients of a single zone influences the water elevation and the flow rate in different cross-sections at different time-steps of the model. In our study, the Strickler coefficient values are sampled from a uniform distribution using a Monte Carlo sampling method, the corresponding simulations are run on a desktop computer and the results are aggregated iteratively and in-transit by the Melissa server to generate ubiquitous Sobol index maps. Melissa provides first order and total order Sobol indices, as well as their 95\% confidence interval. The Sobol indices are useful to identify the most influential Strickler coefficients for each zone at each time-step, leading to a better understanding of the model. The modeler can then adjust the model by either defining more relevant zones for the Strickler coefficients, or fine-tuning the most influential coefficients to fit the model results to field data, with setting the other ones once and for all. This approach can be applied to any other uncertain input parameter.},
