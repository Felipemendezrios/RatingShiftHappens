  abstract = {Abstract             The stage-discharge rating curve is subject at many hydrometric stations to sudden changes (shifts) typically caused by morphogenic floods. We propose an original method for estimating shift times using the stage-discharge observations, also known as gaugings. This method is based on a recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties through a Bayesian framework. It starts with the estimation of a baseline rating curve using all available gaugings. Then it computes the residuals between the gaugings and this rating curve with uncertainties. It proceeds with the segmentation of the time series of residuals through a multi-change point Bayesian estimation accounting for residuals uncertainties. Once the first set of shift times is identified, the same procedure is recursively applied to each sub-period through a ``top-down'' approach searching for all effective shifts. The proposed method is illustrated using the Ard{\`e}che River at Meyras in France (a typical hydrometric site subject to river bed degradation) and evaluated using several synthetic data sets for which the true shift times are known. The applications confirm the added value of the recursive segmentation compared with a ``single-pass'' approach and highlight the importance of properly accounting for uncertainties in the segmented data. The recursive procedure effectively disentangles rating changes from observational and rating curve uncertainties.           ,              Plain Language Summary             For many hydrological and hydraulic issues, such as flood forecasting, a reliable river discharge estimate is needed. In general, discharge is derived from the recorded water level (stage) through a stage-discharge relation (rating curve). This relation is calibrated using direct observations (gaugings). Unfortunately, the rating curve is not only uncertain but it can also be subject to sudden changes or shifts due for example to intense floods that modify the river bed geometry. One solution to identify periods of rating curve stability is to apply a segmentation procedure to the gaugings. We propose in this paper an original recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties.           ,              Key Points                                                                We propose a method for detecting rating shifts through the segmentation of residuals between the gaugings and a reference rating curve                                                     The method accounts for observational and rating curve uncertainties and expresses change points in terms of time (rather than position)                                                     The method recursively re-estimates the reference rating curve to improve the detection of small shifts},

  abstract = {Abstract             Stage measurement errors are generally overlooked when streamflow time series are derived from uncertain rating curves. We introduce an original method for propagating stage uncertainties due to two types of stage measurement errors: (i) errors of the stage read during the gauging and (ii) systematic and nonsystematic (independent) errors of the recorded stage time series. The error models are generic and can be used for any probabilistic rating curve estimation method that provides an ensemble of rating curves. The new method is applied to a range of six contrasting hydrometric stations in France. Uncertainty budgets quantifying the contribution of various error sources to the total streamflow uncertainty are computed and compared for streamflow time series averaged at time intervals from hour to year. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the stage time series error model to identify the most sensitive parameters. The results are site specific, which illustrates the key role played by the properties of both the hydrometric site and the gauged catchment. Across the range of sites, stage errors of the gaugings are found to have limited impact on rating curve uncertainty, at least for gaugings performed in fair conditions. Nonsystematic errors in the stage time series have a negligible effect, generally. However, systematic stage errors should not be neglected. Over the six hydrometric stations in this study, the 95\% uncertainty component reflecting stage systematic errors (from {\textpm}0.5 cm to {\textpm}6.8 cm) alone ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average streamflow, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average streamflow as sensors were assumed to be recalibrated every 30 days. Perspectives for improving and validating the streamflow uncertainty estimation techniques are eventually discussed.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Water discharges in rivers are monitored by measuring the water level (known as stage) every 15 minutes or so and by converting it to discharge with a calibrated stage-discharge model (known as rating curve). We introduce an original method for computing the uncertainty of water discharge time series due to the measurement errors of the stage records used as inputs of the stage-discharge model. Systematic errors in stage measurements, for instance due to sensor drift or calibration errors, were found to produce non negligible discharge uncertainties. Over six hydrometric stations with varied conditions, the corresponding discharge uncertainty ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average discharge, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average discharge.           ,              Key Points                                                                Stage errors in gaugings and in stage time series affect streamflow computation                                                     Specific error models are introduced and used to compute streamflow time series uncertainties                                                     Effect of stage errors depends on site characteristics and averaging time intervals, systematic stage errors being the most impactful},

  abstract = {Abstract             Stage-fall-discharge (SFD) rating curves are traditionally used to compute streamflow records at sites where the energy slope of the flow is variable due to variable backwater effects. We introduce a model with hydraulically interpretable parameters for estimating SFD rating curves and their uncertainties. Conventional power functions for channel and section controls are used. The transition to a backwater-affected channel control is computed based on a continuity condition, solved either analytically or numerically. The practical use of the method is demonstrated with two real twin-gauge stations, the Rh{\^o}ne River at Valence, France, and the Guthusbekken stream at station 0003{$\cdot$}0033, Norway. Those stations are typical of a channel control and a section control, respectively, when backwater-unaffected conditions apply. The performance of the method is investigated through sensitivity analysis to prior information on controls and to observations (i.e., available gaugings) for the station of Valence. These analyses suggest that precisely identifying SFD rating curves requires adapted gauging strategy and/or informative priors. The Madeira River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon, provides a challenging case typical of large, flat, tropical river networks where bed roughness can also be variable in addition to slope. In this case, the difference in staff gauge reference levels must be estimated as another uncertain parameter of the SFD model. The proposed Bayesian method is a valuable alternative solution to the graphical and empirical techniques still proposed in hydrometry guidance and standards.           ,              Key Points                                                                A Bayesian method with hydraulically interpretable parameters for stage-fall-discharge rating curves                                                     Sensitivity analyses to available prior information and gaugings                                                     Application to three twin-gauge stations, with distinct hydraulic configurations},

  abstract = {Establishing streamflow time series in unstable rivers is challenged by changes in the stage-discharge relation after floods. Then, the field hydrologist must develop a new stage-discharge rating curve using new calibration data but also using some information from previous calibration data and previous rating curves. The process includes a large amount of informal expert knowledge and hydraulic assumptions seldom made explicit. This paper develops a stage-period-discharge (SPD) model based on the physical interpretation of changes in the stage-discharge relation across a series of stability periods defined by known dates and times. Using simple hydraulic equations, the user provides prior knowledge on the controls, their static and varying parameters, and their possible changes. As a single model is used for all the periods, the estimation of all rating curves can be performed in one go: All gaugings hence provide information to estimate the static parameters and the varying parameters for the relevant periods. Bayesian inference is used, providing a natural way to include prior knowledge and to quantify uncertainty. The generality and some key properties of the method are demonstrated through application to two hydrometric stations, differing in hydraulic configuration and in number and type of changes. Specific experiments demonstrate the ability of the SPD model to transfer information across periods. Consequently, rating curves are more precisely estimated than by separately estimating them for each period. The SPD model provides a hydraulically based, transparent, and user-friendly approach to replace manual shift corrections traditionally applied in operational practice, with a quantification of uncertainties.},
